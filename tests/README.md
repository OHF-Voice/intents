# Tests

Test sentences and their corresponding intents.


## File Format

``` yaml
language: "<language code>"
tests:
  - sentences:
      - "<sentence>"
      - "<sentence>"
    intent:
      name: "<intent name>"
      slots:
        <slot_name>:
          value: <slot value>
areas:
  - name: "<area name>"
    id: "<area id>"
names:
  - name: "<entity name>"
    id: "<entity id>"
```

Each test sentence must be recognized as the named intent, and each slot value must match exactly.

The `areas` and `names` sections are used to populate the `{area}` and `{name}` lists that will be generated by Home Assistant during actual recognition.

By convention, areas and entity names are collected into a `_common.yaml` file.
